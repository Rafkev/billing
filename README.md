# billing
A customer billing system written in C language
This program allows the user to input items, quantities, and prices, calculates the total amount, and generates a bill for the customer.

In this program:

I defined a structure Item to represent each item, containing the name, quantity, and price.
I prompted the user to input the number of items and details for each item, such as name, quantity, and price.
I calculated the total amount by multiplying the quantity and price of each item and summing up the results.
I then printed the bill, displaying the item name, quantity, price, and the total amount.

Please note that this is a basic example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world billing system, you might need additional features such as error handling, support for different payment methods, tax calculation, and more sophisticated data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
